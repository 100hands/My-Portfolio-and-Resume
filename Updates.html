                <p>Added this section to my resume so anyone can see the progress I'm making. 
                    Today I am learning about fonts. I managed to change the font and font size of the header to this site, I'm hoping to learn more about borders so I can really start stylizing this place lol. 
                    Yesterday I got my acceptance letter to BMCC, I'll be persuing an associates in Web Development. I'm looking forward to it, I'm excited to go to college. I can't explain how I fell into web development, I always had a knack for any sort of technological skill. 
                    I'm able to get about a section a day done on Angela Yu's 2024 Web Development Bootcamp. I probably could do more, I just don't want this taking up a major part of my day, I still have other responsabilites.</p>

            <p>It's 2:33 AM, I've been learning a lot. I started going to therapy and started a seller account on Fiverr. On top of that, I've been doing my day-to-day studies on web development.
            I updated the resume site to look a little more 'pretty.' I also updated here as well. I learned how to add boxes of text, add borders, floating images and text so they fit in a box. I'm coming along.
            I've also started using Sololearn again. I started using it about a year ago, but fell off. It definitely helps keep information fresh. Plus, it's an extra certficate, that's always good.
            I still have to update the other parts of my site here, like My Contacts and About Me pages. It's about 3AM now, so I'll work on that probably tomorrow. I've stayed up all night building this site. I think that's all for now. Until next time.</p>

            <h2><li>8-6-2024</li></h2>
            <p>Smaller update today, I decided to go back and make some updates to some old projects from my WD course. I also decided I'm going to put my resume and my portfolio onto one site, so you'll be able to read all of this and see what I've done in one place.üòÅ<br>
            I finished another section today, I'm about to start section 10. I've also, since my last update, started a profile on Fiverr. Hopefully I can get some good experience with that. Anyways, that's all for now.</p>

        <h2><li>8-24-2024</li></h2>
        <p>Been a little while since my last update, my bad. This month has been a blur, with prepping for this one boys night
            at the end of the month (which has been more drama then it's worth) and getting ready for college, which starts on the 2nd.
            I was tasked with doing a 2nd Capstone project for Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development bootcamp, she pretty much was asking for a "prettier"
            resume. I just updated the one here and counted that. While I'm at it, I'm also doing a little restructuring of the whole site.
            I've been learning more about typography and color theory, so I'll be working on getting better fonts and better themes that suit the eye more.
            Another reason I haven't been able to work on this as much is because of the situation at work. I got quarintined from the work wifi
            because my laptop is built for gaming and has steam installed. I was pretty much pressured into getting another laptop in order to continue studying/developing at work during my free time.
            Pretty bogus, if I'm being totally honest. Anyway, other than that, I started therapy this month as well. I've actually been enjoying it,
            I feel I'm making good personal progress for once in my life. I've only had 2 sessions so far, so it could be
            to early to say anything, but for once I'm actually looking forward to what's in store for me in the future.
        </p>

    <div id="update">
        <h2><li>8-28-2024</li></h2>
        <p>Finished some more tweaks to this site, got the colors right to give it a more professional feel. 
            I'm still contemplating changing the text for the headers but that'll be for later. I also added logos to my contacts page, now it looks snazzy if I do say so myself. With college less then a week away, I'm giddy with anticipation!
            I just want to start my classes already. I have the books, all the notebooks a person could ever need, many pens and pencils (mechanical of course), highlighters, and even removeable highlighters.
            Who knew that was a thing? Definitely not me, lol. Anyway, my last week of summer is looking to be pretty fun. I'm going with a couple buddies to go see Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper on Friday, it's going to be a great time! 
            Anyways, that's all for now.</p>
