            <h2><li>Summary</li></h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Kalen Parker, also known online as One Hundred Hands. I'm a 27-year-old web development enthusiast with a passion for learning and overcoming challenges. 
                Despite being born with only one hand, I’ve never let it hold me back. I believe in my ability to achieve anything I set my mind to. 
                Recently, I've embarked on a journey to master web development and programming, earning three certificates in Python from Coursera, with two more on the way. 
                Currently, I'm excelling in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp, and I'm eager to continue growing in this field as an aspiring web developer.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I earned my GED in 2021 after taking some time to discover my true passion. In 2023, I found that passion in coding, which led me to begin taking online courses on platforms like Coursera and Udemy. 
                Recently, I completed my college placement test and am thrilled to start my journey this fall, pursuing an Associate’s degree in Web Development. I'm also planning to advance to a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems.</p>

        <div id="experience">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>While my past work experience hasn’t been directly related to Computer Science, it has equipped me with a strong interest in technology and systems. 
                Since 2016, I’ve held six different jobs, which have helped me develop a strong work ethic and adaptability. These roles include working as a night shift Steward, a 3rd shift Casino Attendant, a 2nd shift Security Guard, and a Slot Attendant. 
                Most notably, I spent five years as a Surveillance Monitor, where I worked with surveillance cameras, servers, and web applications to access camera feeds.</p>
